Create a program in C that takes in input:

bingogame <n> <m>

The program will simulate a Bingo game between n players, for each given m cards.
There will be a Dealer that extracts numbers in a range between 1 and 75.
Cards are composed by 3 rows and 5 columuns, so 15 numbers in total all distinct in a single card.
There are only two prizes: five (a row of five winning numbers) and bingo (a completed card).

The program, once started, will create 1+n threads: a single thread Dealer named D and n Player threads (P1, P2, ..., Pn).
All thread must coordinate with semaphores and, if needed, mutexes.
There will be a single shared structure that contains the semaphores and mutexes, and some other variables that can't be initialized first with values depending from n and m.

In the first phase of the program, the Dealer will casually generate n*m cards; these will be assigned to the players using the shared structure.
After ALL cards are given to players, phase two will start with the extraction of random numbers. No duplicate numbers can be extracted.
For each extraction, the number will be notified to all players using the shared structure and coordination objects.
If a player wins a prize, he will notify the dealer.
There can be only one winner of five, and, after a player wins the bingo, the game (and the program) will end.
All threads and thread main must terminate their execution correctly.
